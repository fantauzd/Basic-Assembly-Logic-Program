Write and test a MASM program to perform the following tasks:

Display your name and program title on the output screen.
Display instructions for the user.
Prompt the user to enter three numbers (A, B, C) in strictly descending order.
Calculate the sum and differences: (A+B, A-B, A+C, A-C, B+C, B-C, A+B+C).
Display the results of the above calculations.
Display a closing message.
Program Requirements
The program must be fully documented and laid out according to the CS271 Style Guide. This includes a complete header block for identification, description, etc., and a comment outline to explain each section of code.
The main procedure must be divided into the following separate and distinct logical sections:
introduction
get the data
calculate the required values
display the results
say goodbye
When displaying the results, restate the inputs in equation form (e.g. "5 + 4 = 9") rather than using placeholder letters (see the Example Execution below).
The results of calculations must be stored in named variables before being displayed.
